# ROG Zephyrus G14 (2021, 4900HS, RTX 2060) Hackintosh Config

This is the working configuration that I'm currently using on my Hackintosh install. 
Verified to work on Monterey.

Uses NootedRed for Vega 8 iGPU acceleration.

Note: Kect Config is very out of date, consider using https://chefkissinc.github.io/guide/guide-differences to migrate USB Mapping & Remove AMDRyzenCPUPowerManagement
