# ROG Zephyrus G14 (2021, 4900HS, RTX 2060) Hackintosh Config

This is the working configuration that I'm currently using on my Hackintosh install. 
Verified to work on Sequoia, with best performance by limiting speed to 1400MHZ using AMD Power Gadget.

Uses NootedRed for Vega 8 iGPU acceleration, without which this project would not be possible.
Wifi works with this computer's stock AX200 card, but requires a NVRAM reset if dual booting.
